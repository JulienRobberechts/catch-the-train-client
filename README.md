## How many times did you get to the station only to miss the train by 1 minute? Never again with this handy application!

### It will help you catch your train by indicating the best time to set off, based on the duration of your journey to the station and the live departure board. You can even plan time for a coffee!

### "rien ne sert de courir il faut partir Ã  point"

This application only works on RER A in France for now. (more train lines will be added in future versions).
